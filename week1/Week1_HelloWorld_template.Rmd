```{r load libraries, include=FALSE}
# run this line (uncomment) to install readr from CRAN:
install.packages("readr")

# make sure your R has this library loaded, if not install it (see lines above).
# Also, RStudio will offer to install it for you if it finds you try to load it if you haven't installed it yet.

library(readr)

```{r code}

1:5
```

# Play around with RMarkdown

Try to play around with Rmarkdown. You can find a cheatsheet in RStudio under Help.

*RStudio has also linked Cheatsheets for Rmarkdown in the Help section*
